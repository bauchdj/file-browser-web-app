  "description": "If you're like me, you have photos, videos and files you want to access and share privately. With some technical know how and a few dollars a month you could host your own server and have all your files stored safely on the cloud accessible through any browser. Cloud services are expensive and there's no way to gaurentee your infomation is private. Plus, they require other people to have an account to access any files you share. In general, storing files and sharing them is tough. I plan on making self hosted cloud storage and file sharing easy and simple, whether it be from a laptop or mobile device.",
